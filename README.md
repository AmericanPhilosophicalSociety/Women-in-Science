# Women in Science
Open data used for powering the American Philosophical Society's project [Visualizing Women in Science](https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/womeninscience).

## What are these data?
The American Philosophcial Society (APS) holds the collections of several women scientists. Using these collections as a starting point, we combed the correspondence housed at the APS for evidence of collaboration and connections between women scientists. This data was used to build a network visualization; however, the raw data available in this repository contains additional information about the sources for the nodes and edges in the network. 

## Who created these data?
- Mackenzie Mahoney, SUNY Oswego
- Bayard Miller, Center for Digital Scholarship
- David Ragnar Nelson, Center for Digital Scholarship
- Graziella Pierangeli, Bryn Mawr College
- Serenity Sutherland, SUNY Oswego

## How were these data created?
Please see each individual dataset's documentation for detailed information on its process, structure, and sources.

## What these datasets are not?
Open historic data are not a replacement for or an identical recreation of the original manuscript records from which they were created. Rather, they are intended to to these collections easier to explore.

These datasets were created as part of the American Philosophical Society's Open Data Initiative (Learn more at http://diglib.amphilsoc.org/data).
Although contributors took care to minimize mistakes and inconsistencies in the creation of these items, and have included any assumptions or choices made on their part that may affect interoperability or integrity of the data, APS cannot guarantee that they are free of instances of human error. They are offered "as is," and researchers are encouraged to consult the original records in digital or physical format in the event of uncertainty.
