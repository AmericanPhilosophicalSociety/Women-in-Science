In 1923, she took an unpaid position at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In 1938, she was force to leave Austria following the German annexation of Austria. Albert Einstein helped secure a position for her in Mexico, but she left for the United States in 1938 due to poor research conditions. There, she joined the US Atomic Energy Commission and worked at several universities. In 1960, she returned to her unpaid position at the Austrian Academy of Sciences due to a medically necessary operation she could not afford to have in the US. She was nominated twice for the Nobel Prize but did not win. In 1950, Cecil Powell won the Nobel Prize in Physics for work done using her methods.",

She finished her PhD in 1906 and then spent two years at Columbia University. In 1910 she returned to Norway to be a professor at Bergen Museum. At the time, women were not allowed to hold positions of office, which professorships were categorized under in Norway, and two colleagues, Georg Sars and Robert Collett, pushed for Norway's Parliament to change the law. In 1912 an act called \"Lex Bonnevie\" granted women the right to hold positions as professors. She remained a professor at Royal Frederick University until 1937. Later in her career she also studied fingerprints to see if they could determine hereditary connections. She also contributed to the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation at the League of Nations—alongside Marie Curie and Albert Einstein—between 1922 and 1933.",

However, her most popular works include <i>Under the Sea</i> (1941), <i>The Sea Around Us</i> (1952), <i>The Edge of the Sea</i> (1955), and <i>Silent Spring</i> (1962). In the 1950s, Carson conducted research into the effects of pesticides on the food chain, condemning the pesticide DDT. Although she had been criticized by the chemical industry for her outspoken opinions on DDT, even having a large campaign developed to discredit her research findings, she continuously expressed the danger pesticides have on marine life and wildlife. DDT was eventually banned after the influence of her research, helping shape the government's environmental consciousness and motivation to preserve wildlife. After suffering from breast cancer for quite some time, Carson died in Silver Spring, Maryland at age 58.",

Cori faced numerous challenges as a woman of Jewish heritage. As girls' schools did not offer instruction in all subjects at the time, Cori independently studied Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics to pass the entrance exams for the medical school of the Charles University in Prague. During her studies, she met her husband Carl, whom she married in 1920, the year of her graduation. Subsequently, they moved to Vienna. However, poor conditions in post-war Europe and increasing antisemitism led them to move to the United States in 1922. After several years at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, they began to look for university positions. Her husband received numerous offers, but few universities were willing to hire her as well. In 1931, they both received positions at Washington University in St. Louis, but Cori was offered much less pay than her position. She did not become full professor until 1947, the same year she won the Nobel Prize. Both the metabolic pathway for converting glycogen into glucose (the Cori cycle) and the molecule that catalyzes the process (the Cori ester) are named after Cori and her husband.",

In 1895 she married French physicist Pierre Curie and together they researched radioactivity, which led to sharing the 1903 Nobel Prize along with Henri Becquerel. The Curies are credited with discovering both polonium and radium and coining the word radioactivity. After Pierre Curie's tragic accident and death by a fast-moving carriage, Marie Curie focused on growing the Radium Institute to study the new phenomenon of radioactivity. During World War I she worked to develop medical technologies relying on radium that could save the lives of soldiers on the front, specifically mobile X-ray units. She died in 1934 likely due to long-term exposure to radiation, which damaged her bone marrow.",

Educated in Lausanne, Kharkiv, and Moscow, Danchakoff became the first woman in Russia both to receive a medical degree and be appointed a professor. In 1915, she moved to the United States and took a position at Columbia University. Danchakoff made many important discoveries in embryology and was one of the first to provide a theoretical explanation of stem cells. During the 1920s, Danchakoff was a tireless advocate for scientists in the Soviet Union and organized relief efforts to publicize the struggles of and provide support to scientists during the Russian famine of 1921-22. After her unit was dissolved in 1934, Danchakoff returned to the Soviet Union, taking a position in Lithuania; however, she remained a US citizen. During the 1930s, she demonstrated the key role played by hormones in mammalian sex differentiation. Evidence in the Warren H. Lewis papers suggest she was forced from her position and returned to the US in the late 1930s, but it is unclear what happened to her after that. Nonetheless, she continued her research up until her death in 1950.",

Dunn corresponded with Florence Seibert about the latter's investigations into cancer, providing critical feedback on Seibert's work.",

Nonetheless, she created a department for experimental cell research at the Charité Hospital in Berlin and helped advance the state of cytology considerably in Germany. In 1933, she was falsely accused of being Jewish and of having helped secure positions for Jewish students. She was jailed again. However, international pressure led to her release.

Her findings advocated that milk be pasteurized to protect consumers from bacteria. Evans contracted undulunt fever in 1922 and remained sensitive to brucellosis, which halted her work. In 1928 she became president of the Society for American Bacteriologists, the first woman to hold the position. She was awarded honorary doctoral degrees from Women's Medical College of Medicine, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Wilson College.",

Evans was educated in Edinburgh, Boston, and Baltimore. Upon completing her training, she returned to her native England, but had difficulty finding a job on account of sexism in the medical field. She instead went back to the United States and worked in Boston and Chicago before landing a job at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. In 1972, she was appointed a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania, where she worked with Mildred Cohn, Mary Osbakken, and Elizabeth E. Miller. Evans is called the \"mother of neuroblastoma\" due to her success in treating this condition. Thanks to her efforts, the rate of mortality due to neuroblastoma has reduced by about 50%. Evans also contributed to the founding of the Ronald McDonald House. ",

During this time, she corresponded with Florence Seibert, sharing research materials with her. In 1959, Hobby left Pfizer to specialize in chronic infectious diseases as chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital. She later founded a monthly publication entitled <i>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</i>, which she edited for years. ",

Born to German immigrant parents she first enrolled at the Illinois Industrial University in Champaign. Leaving for financial reasons, she continued to work and save for another seven years, teaching school until she saved enough money to attend Cornell University and graduate in 1891. She then spent time studying at Bryn Mawr and the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in the summer. She applied to the Heidelberg University in Germany, however, the field she wished to study in, physiology, was not open to women. Physiology professor Wilhelm Kühne jokingly agreed to examine Hyde at the completion of her studies, \"if that time should ever come,\" but when pressured to follow through on his claim, he did not allow Hyde to attend his lectures or work in the laboratory. With Kühne's permission, the male physiologist's assistants helped Hyde and gave her the information required to pass her doctoral examination in 1896. At that point, Kühne then permitted Hyde to work in the laboratory and would go on to recommend her for Heidelberg University's seat at the Naples Zoological Station, which Hyde held in 1896. When she returned to the United States, Hyde presented her idea to hold a chair at the Naples Table for women scientists. The ACA (which became the AAUW in 1921) heard Hyde's request and established The Naples Table Association for Promoting Research by Women. In 1899 Hyde established the physiology department at the University of Kansas where she worked throughout her career. She also invented an underwater microelectrode.",

She worked closely with Opie and Phipps Institute statistician Persis Putnam on comparative studies on tuberculosis, comparing the spread of the disease in Jamaica with its spread in Philadelphia. In her correspondence with Opie, Isaacs repeatedly attributes the spread of tuberculosis in Jamaica to social reasons such as poverty or inadequate housing; however, in more recent years, these studies have been critiqued for conflating these social conditions with the patients' race.",

Joteyko spent much of her career in Belgium, conducting research at the Solvay Physiological Institute and lecturing at the Free University of Brussels. While Joteyko's early research concerned the workings of the nervous system, she increasingly became interested in childhood development. This led to an increasing interest in social organization and pedagogy. When Poland became independent in1918, Joteyko returned but was unable to secure a research position due to discrimination against women. She therefore turned her attention to social reform and social pedagogy. Joteyko was nominated for the Ellen Richards Research Prize in 1928.",

Lancefield's research into streptococci led her to devise a classification system for the bacteria. This system, called the Lancefield grouping, allowed researchers to separate the streptococci that infected humans from those that only affected animals based on the carbohydrate composition of bacterial antigens found on their cell walls. Lancefield held numerous honors. She was the second woman president of the Society of American Bacteriologists and the first woman president of the American Association of Immunologists. She was additionally elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1970. She published more than 50 publications over her 60-year career.

She spent parts of the 1930s in hiding and was unable to work in a university lab as a result of Mussolini's Race Laws; however, she refused to give up her research and set up a small lab inside her bedroom. After the war, she was recruited to work as a doctor before returning to lab work. At Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri, she discovered Nerve Growth Factor, which opened many doors for the treatment of cancer, dementia, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's. Alongside Stanley Cohen, Levi-Montalcini won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of nerve growth factor. She was dedicated to ensuring that other scientists would have the resources and support they needed, so she founded and directed the Institute of Cell Biology, founded the European Brain Research Institute, and established the Rita Levi-Montalcini Foundation to help support the education of African women. She was also elected to hold a lifelong Senate position in Italy in 2001.",

In the 1930s she and Harriet Creighton discovered \"crossing over,\" in which chromosomes break and recombine to create genetic changes. In the 1950s, she discovered the occurrence of transposable genetic elements and their effect on gene expression; that is, that genes are not fixed like pearls on a string but that they move or \"jump\" around. McClintock's findings were ignored, partly because the complex development patterns of maize were not as clear to everyone else (especially non-maize geneticists) as they were to her. However, when these findings were confirmed in independent studies of bacteria, she received wide acclaim for her earlier work. McClintock remains the only woman to win an unshared Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.",

She met secretly with Hahn in Copenhagen where they conducted the first successful experiments in nuclear fission. Although Hahn led the experiments, Meitner and her nephew worked out the theoretical explanation. Their discoveries became the basis for the Manhattan project, a project Meitner refused to touch out of ethical concerns.

Mertz was instrumental in the discovery of methods for joining DNA from different species and creating recombinant DNA cloned in bacteria. Mertz studied biochemistry at Stanford under Paul Berg. Berg encouraged Mertz to study the replication and expression recombinant DNA in <i>E. coli</i>, and she developed a research plan that would involve inserting three strands of DNA into an <i>E. coli</i> sample. However, while working at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1971, concerns were raised about the potential ramifications of such a procedure. As <i>E. coli</i> was a common human pathogen, the safety concerns if such a sample were introduced into the general population were enormous. This led to an informal moratorium on all cloning experiments, leading Mertz to focus on developing techniques for constructing recombinant DNA. Later, other scientists, including Berg, used her methods in combination with cloning <i>E. coli</i>, which led to enormous advances in biotechnology. Berg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in part due to Mertz's discoveries. After receiving her PhD, Mertz became a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and has made many important discoveries in gene expression in viruses and cancer research. Mertz has also played an active role in debunking myths about the role of gender in mathematical aptitude.",

In the 1950s and 1960s, she turned her attention to mouse genetics while conducting research at the University of Chicago and the Fox Chase Cancer Center. Mintz was interested in a lethal blood disorder, but the mice embryos were not viable long enough for study. She developed a process for fusing two mice embryos, creating a \"chimeric\" or allophenic mouse. These fused mice allowed Mintz not only to study the blood disorder, but also to understand how complex organs formed during development. In the 1970s, Mintz used this technique of creating allophenic mice to study cancer. By fusing the embryos of mice susceptible to liver cancer with those of mice that were not, she demonstrated that cancers were grown from a single cell or unit of cells rather than a combination of cells. She also determined that both genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to the development of cancer. In her later years, Mintz experimented with injecting DNA directly into an animal's egg cell, paving the way for later developments in gene therapy.",

In 1904, she married Morgan and followed him around while he moved between labs. After the birth of her first child in 1906, she took a step back from research to raise the family's children. This sacrifice likely enabled her husband's scientific success. When her children were older, she returned to research, working in her husband's lab. However, the male scientists, including her husband, viewed her with suspicion and only provided her with laboratory space She only received her first official appointment as a Research Associate at the California Institute of Technology after her husband's death in 1945. Despite these challenges, she was a well-regarded geneticist whose name carried weight in the scientific community.

In 1915, Noether took on a position at the University of Göttingen, also without pay. While she later received a paying position, her career in Germany was cut short when she had to flee on account of being Jewish. She settled in Bryn Mawr, where she continued to teach until her early death in 1935. In physics, she is best remembered for Noether's theorem, which allowed for new developments in classical and quantum physics. In mathematics, Noether is credited with laying much of the groundwork for the development of abstract algebra.

Her brother studied physics at the University of Göttingen, giving her access to his textbooks. While performing domestic chores, such as washing the dishes, Pockels started to ask questions about the effects of soap on water. She conducted experiments out of her own home, developing an apparatus to take measurements of the soapy water's surface properties. These experiments allowed Pockels to provide a thorough explanation of surface tension and paved the way for the modern discipline of surface science. Pockels never had a paid position as a scientist and, despite publishing 14 papers, spent most of her life as a caretaker for her parents.

At the time, the only entrance requirement was surviving an intense one-on-one interview with Clarke, which Ratner passed successfully. During her time at Columbia, Ratner focused on problems in organic chemistry, studying the reactions of complex molecules. She also observed that a compound in human semen could cause uterine contractions, a finding that was published by her colleagues Raphael Kurzrok and Charles Lieb in a paper that acknowledged her assistance but did not provide coauthorship. Ratner had difficulty finding a position after graduation due to her gender, but eventually received a position in Rudolf Schoenheimer's lab at Columbia. In 1946, she became an assistant professor of pharmacology at New York University. In the mid-1950s, she left the university system to become a staff member at the Department of Biochemistry at the Public Health Research Institute of New York. Ratner's most significant scientific contributions concern metabolism, particularly amino acid metabolism and nitrogen metabolism. Her contributions have led to a more complete picture of disorders in urea synthesis.",

At Hopkins, Sabin became the protégé of Franklin P. Mall, who encouraged her research interests in anatomy. By any reckoning, her talent for medical investigation was enormous, earning her an internship at Hopkins Hospital, followed by a special fellowship in the Department of Anatomy from the Baltimore Association for the Advancement of University Education of Women. By 1917, Sabin was made a member of the faculty in the Department of Histology, the first woman at the University to be promoted to the status of full professor. Her early research centered on the embryological origins of the lymphatic system, and she later worked on the origins of blood, blood cells, and blood vessels, on the histology of the brain, and on the pathology and immunology of tuberculosis. In September, 1925, Sabin accepted the invitation to head the Department of Cellular Studies at the Rockefeller Institute, becoming the first woman faculty member there, and continuing her work on tuberculosis. She retired to Colorado in 1938, but emerged six years later at the request of the governor to chair a subcommittee on public health and help reform and modernize the state's public health system. She retired a second time in 1951 and died October 3, 1953.",

Born in Easton, Pennsylvania, Seibert contracted polio at an early age. As a result, she would suffer from a lifelong limp. Spurred by her interest in science, she was awarded a scholarship to Goucher College, where she earned a degree in chemistry in 1918. After briefly working as a chemist at a paper mill, she went on to study for a doctorate at Yale University. As part of her graduate work, under Lafayette B. Mendel, she discovered which proteins caused fevers after patients had been injected with protein solutions containing distilled water. She then invented a distilling apparatus that prevented bacterial contamination. She received her Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1923. From 1924 to 1928, Seibert, as a Porter Fellow at the University of Chicago, served as a pathology instructor and continued her research in pyrogenic distilled water. During this time she met Esmond R. Long, who was working on tuberculosis. In 1932, she relocated with Long to the Henry Phipps Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, as an assistant professor in biochemistry. With funding from the National Tuberculosis Association, the two worked for thirty-one years, collaborating and developing methods for separating and purifying the protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, obtaining purified protein derivative (PPD) thus enabling the creation of a reliable test for the disease. She published her first work on purification of tuberculin in 1934. From 1937-1938, while working with Theodor Svedberg at the University of Uppsala, Sweden, she developed methods for purifying a crystalline tuberculin derivative, therefore, successfully isolating the tuberculosis protein molecule. By 1940, Seibert had improved her protein purification procedure sufficiently for it to become the international standard for use in tuberculin tests. For this work, she received the Trudeau Medal from the National Tuberculosis Association in 1938, the Garvan Medal from the American Chemical Society in 1941, and the first Achievement Award from the Association of University Women in 1943. Other awards she received, during this time, include the National Achievement Award of 1944 and the Gimbel Award of 1946. Upon her retirement from the Phipps Institute in 1959, she moved, with her sister Mabel, to St. Petersburg, Florida. She continued her research of the relationship between bacteria and types of cancer at the Mound Park Hospital and the Bay Pines V.A. Research Center. She continued to publish scientific papers until 1977. She died in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1991.",

Welsh worked as Assistant Resident in the State Hospital for the Insane at Norristown, Pennsylvania, and Sherwood in Baltimore where she practiced medicine. Welsh joined Sherwood in Baltimore in 1892. In 1894, Sherwood became Lecturer in Hygiene at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore and Director of Health. At about the same time, Dr. Welsh was made Director of Health at Goucher College. Sherwood and Welsh opened the Evening Dispensary for Working Women and Children in Baltimore.

In 1908, she began her graduate work at the University of Chicago, where she remained for the remainder of her career. Slye's legacy is mixed. While she is credited for her discovery of cancer's heritability, she also believed that cancer was passed on through a recessive trait and could be eradicated through breeding. Already during her life, this eugenicist premise caused controversy.",

Sabin recounts her opinion of Stein in a letter to another graduate of Johns Hopkins, Joseph M. Flint. There, she ridicules Stein as a sloppy researcher and accuses her of making a mess of the laboratory.

After graduation, she was offered a position at a pediatric clinic at Johns Hopkins, where she would remain for the rest of her career. Her research led to the concept for a procedure that would extend the lives of children born with what was commonly called \"blue baby syndrome\" and is medically known as Tetralogy of Fallot. Taussig's research led to a procedure known as the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt, a surgical procedure that alleviates the situation. Taussig is also known for her work in banning thalidomide, a drug that pregnant women took to prevent morning sickness, but had the unknown side effect of limiting the growth of a fetus's limbs.

Her laboratory has pioneered the use of computational and experimental analyses in the identification of actively transposing elements. She received her Ph.D. in 1980 in Biochemistry from Cornell University. As a postdoctoral fellow of the American Cancer Society at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Baltimore (1980-82) she was involved in the molecular isolation of the Ac and Ds transposable elements that were first discovered by Barbara McClintock almost 40 years earlier in maize. She began her career at the University of Georgia in 1983 where she remained until moving to UC Riverside in 2010. Wessler has contributed extensively to educational initiatives, including co-authorship of the widely used genetics textbook, Introduction to Genetic Analysis. As a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor (2006), she adapted her research program for the classroom by developing the Dynamic Genome Courses where incoming freshman can experience the excitement of scientific discovery. She is the recipient of several awards including the the inaugural Distinguished Scientist Award (2007) from the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA), the Stephen Hales Prize (2011) from the American Society of Plant Biologists, and the Excellence in Science Award from FASEB (2012).

Witkin studied biology at Columbia University with Theodosius Dobzhansky, who arranged for Witkin to spend time at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. While there, she began working with <i>E. coli</i> and discovered a UV-radiation resistant variant of <i>E. coli</i>. This sparked her interest in studying the variation in mutations induced in bacteria through exposure to UV radiation. In the early 1970s, Witkin collaborated with Miroslav Radman to discover an SOS response triggered by UV radiation that, under certain conditions, can lead to DNA repair. In addition to her work in science, Witkin was politically active in her youth. She was one of the \"Bates Seven,\" a group of students who protested the exclusion of Black athletes from games played on segregated southern universities. As retribution, her admission to New York University was revoked, leading her to Columbia and Dobzhansky's lab.",

Starting in 1931, Wrinch became interested in biochemistry and applied mathematics to the study of the structure of chromosomes and proteins. Her theories received negative attention from Linus Pauling, who publicly attacked her theories. This made it difficult for her to advance her career. Nonetheless, she moved to the United States in 1939 and ended up teaching at Smith College, Amherst College, and Mount Holyoke College.",
