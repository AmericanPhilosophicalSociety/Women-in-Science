In this network, her efforts manifest in the tireless attempts she made at securing jobs for scholars displaced by fascism. She wrote numerous letters on behalf of scholars such as Lise Meitner and Hertha Sponer in an attempt to find them safe passage out of Germany.

In 1895 she married French physicist Pierre Curie and together they researched radioactivity, which led to sharing the 1903 Nobel Prize along with Henri Becquerel. The Curies are credited with discovering both polonium and radium and coining the word radioactivity. After Pierre Curie's tragic accident and death by a fast-moving carriage, Marie Curie focused on growing the Radium Institute to study the new phenomenon of radioactivity. During World War I she worked to develop medical technologies relying on radium that could save the lives of soldiers on the front, specifically mobile X-ray units.

With Kühne's permission, the male physiologist's assistants helped Hyde and gave her the information required to pass her doctoral examination in 1896. At that point, Kühne then permitted Hyde to work in the laboratory and would go on to recommend her for Heidelberg University's seat at the Naples Zoological Station, which Hyde held in 1896.

Mertz was instrumental in the discovery of methods for joining DNA from different species and creating recombinant DNA cloned in bacteria. Mertz studied biochemistry at Stanford under Paul Berg. Berg encouraged Mertz to study the replication and expression recombinant DNA in <i>E. coli</i>, and she developed a research plan that would involve inserting three strands of DNA into an <i>E. coli</i> sample. However, while working at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1971, concerns were raised about the potential ramifications of such a procedure. As <i>E. coli</i> was a common human pathogen, the safety concerns if such a sample were introduced into the general population were enormous. This led to an informal moratorium on all cloning experiments, leading Mertz to focus on developing techniques for constructing recombinant DNA. Later, other scientists, including Berg, used her methods in combination with cloning <i>E. coli</i>, which led to enormous advances in biotechnology. Berg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in part due to Mertz's discoveries. After receiving her PhD, Mertz became a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and has made many important discoveries in gene expression in viruses and cancer research.

In the 1950s and 1960s, she turned her attention to mouse genetics while conducting research at the University of Chicago and the Fox Chase Cancer Center. Mintz was interested in a lethal blood disorder, but the mice embryos were not viable long enough for study. She developed a process for fusing two mice embryos, creating a ""chimeric"" or allophenic mouse. These fused mice allowed Mintz not only to study the blood disorder, but also to understand how complex organs formed during development. In the 1970s, Mintz used this technique of creating allophenic mice to study cancer. By fusing the embryos of mice susceptible to liver cancer with those of mice that were not, she demonstrated that cancers were grown from a single cell or unit of cells rather than a combination of cells. She also determined that both genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to the development of cancer. In her later years, Mintz experimented with injecting DNA directly into an animal's egg cell, paving the way for later developments in gene therapy.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Mintz,Thomas Foxen Anderson|Baruch S.

Born in Easton, Pennsylvania, Seibert contracted polio at an early age. As a result, she would suffer from a lifelong limp. Spurred by her interest in science, she was awarded a scholarship to Goucher College, where she earned a degree in chemistry in 1918. After briefly working as a chemist at a paper mill, she went on to study for a doctorate at Yale University. As part of her graduate work, under Lafayette B. Mendel, she discovered which proteins caused fevers after patients had been injected with protein solutions containing distilled water. She then invented a distilling apparatus that prevented bacterial contamination. She received her Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1923. From 1924 to 1928, Seibert, as a Porter Fellow at the University of Chicago, served as a pathology instructor and continued her research in pyrogenic distilled water. During this time she met Esmond R. Long, who was working on tuberculosis. In 1932, she relocated with Long to the Henry Phipps Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, as an assistant professor in biochemistry. With funding from the National Tuberculosis Association, the two worked for thirty-one years, collaborating and developing methods for separating and purifying the protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, obtaining purified protein derivative (PPD) thus enabling the creation of a reliable test for the disease. She published her first work on purification of tuberculin in 1934. From 1937-1938, while working with Theodor Svedberg at the University of Uppsala, Sweden, she developed methods for purifying a crystalline tuberculin derivative, therefore, successfully isolating the tuberculosis protein molecule. By 1940, Seibert had improved her protein purification procedure sufficiently for it to become the international standard for use in tuberculin tests. For this work, she received the Trudeau Medal from the National Tuberculosis Association in 1938, the Garvan Medal from the American Chemical Society in 1941, and the first Achievement Award from the Association of University Women in 1943. Other awards she received, during this time, include the National Achievement Award of 1944 and the Gimbel Award of 1946. Upon her retirement from the Phipps Institute in 1959, she moved, with her sister Mabel, to St. Petersburg, Florida.

Witkin studied biology at Columbia University with Theodosius Dobzhansky, who arranged for Witkin to spend time at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. While there, she began working with <i>E. coli</i> and discovered a UV-radiation resistant variant of <i>E. coli</i>. This sparked her interest in studying the variation in mutations induced in bacteria through exposure to UV radiation. In the early 1970s, Witkin collaborated with Miroslav Radman to discover an SOS response triggered by UV radiation that, under certain conditions, can lead to DNA repair. In addition to her work in science, Witkin was politically active in her youth. She was one of the ""Bates Seven,"" a group of students who protested the exclusion of Black athletes from games played on segregated southern universities. As retribution, her admission to New York University was revoked, leading her to Columbia and Dobzhansky's lab.",,Thomas Foxen Anderson|Seymour S.
