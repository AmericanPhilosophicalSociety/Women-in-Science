Note that over fifty additional collections were consulted but are not primary sources for this dataset. These collections are noted in the dataset itself when relevant.

Data description:
This dataset contains biographical information about women scientists who appear in the history of science collections at the American Philosophical Society. This particular dataset contains additional biographical information about these scientists to augment information available about them in the collection.

This dataset serves as a complement to APSWiS-01, a dataset that lists connections between women scientists in the APS collections.

Column structure and contents:
  - person: A standardized name for the person. This will generally include both a married name and married name, if applicable.
  - id: A unique identifier assigned to the person.
  - id_type: The source for the unique identifier. Identifiers are either VIAF, ORCID, or the local identifier APS-WIS.
  - gender: The person's gender as inferred from name and pronouns. Either M (male) or F (female).
  - DOB: the person's date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format.
  - DOD: the person's date of death in YYYY-MM-DD format.
  - place_of_birth: Where the person was born. Locations may be approximate.
  - field: All scientific fields the person was associated with. This includes departments they were affiliated with and degrees they received, as well as professional societies they were active in. Note that "Medicine" has been reserved for those holding an MD.
  - education: The institutions the person was educated in, in chronological order.
  - affiliation: The academic and professional affiliations of the person, in chronological order
  = publications: A selection of significant publications by the person
  - membership_in_societies: A selection of professional societies and organizations the person belonged to.
  - awards_and_honors_received: A selection of awards and honors the person received.
  - image: A path to an image file for the person. In some cases, this may refer to an internal file for the APS Women in Science project (https://diglib.amphilsoc.org/women-in-science).
  - notes: Any notes or uncertainty collected during the data gathering process.
  - biography: A short, contextual biography for the person
  - relevant_links: Links to external sources that may have been consulted during the data gathering process
  - collection: A list of all APS collections in which a reference to the person is known to exist
  - description: Original notes and data collected during the data gathering process.
  - image_credits: The source for the image
  - image_notes: Contains additional information about images of the person, including links to images for which the rights for use could not be obtained.

Assumptions: 
Some identities have been inferred based on biographical information, particularly in the case where women have married and changed their names. Some places of birth were assumed from where the person grew up and may not reflect the actual location of birth.

Normalizations and Data Standards:
Names generally include both the maiden name and married name. Institutional names have generally been standardized to the largest possible entity (e.g. Johns Hopkins University, not Johns Hopkins School of Medicine).

Caveat Emptor:
These datasets were created as part of the American Philosophical Society's Open Data Initiative (Learn more at http://diglib.amphilsoc.org/data).
Although contributors took care to minimize mistakes and inconsistencies in the creation of these items, and have included any assumptions or choices made on their part that may affect interoperability or integrity of the data, APS cannot guarantee that they are free of instances of human error.

Phase One: 2018
Data gathered by Serenity Sutherland as part of a Digital Humanities Fellowship at the American Philosophical Society Library. Assistance in data formatting provided by Bayard L. Miller and Cynthia Heider.
Phase Two: Spring-Summer 2022
Serenity Sutherland returned to the APS for another fellowship to refine and expand the dataset. David Ragnar Nelson proposed a new data structure and Nelson and Sutherland reformatted the data.
Phase Three: Summer-Fall 2022
Process: David Ragnar Nelson and Bayard L. Miller conducted a survey of the collections of male scientists to fill in gaps in the network. Biographies were written by Nelson, Serenity Sutherland, Mackenzie Mahoney, and Graziella Pierangeli.
Phase Four: Winter 2022-2023
Final data enrichment and cleaning. Documentation created. Dataset and documentation uploaded to the APS Digital Library.
